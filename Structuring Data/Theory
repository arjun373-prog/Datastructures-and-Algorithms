Before you can do anything with most data, you must structure it in some manner so that you can begin to see what the data contains (and, sometimes, what it 
doesn’t). You aren’t changing the data in any way  — simply making the data more useful.

Structure is an essential element in making algorithms work. Implementing an algorithm using structured data is much easier than trying 
to figure out how to interpret the data in code. For example, the binary search example relies on having the data in sorted order. 
Trying to perform the required comparisons with unsorted data would require a lot more effort and potentially prove impossible to implement.

An essential need to meet as part of working with data is to understand the data content. A search algorithm works only when you understand the dataset so that 
you know what to search for using the algorithm. Looking for words when the dataset contains numbers is an impossible task that always results in errors.
